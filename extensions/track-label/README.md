# Track Shipping Labels with ShipEngine

**Author**: ShipEngine (**[https://shipengine.com](https://shipengine.com)**)

**Description**: Provides a callable https function for retrieving label tracking data and a https webhook endpoint for live tracking updates from a ShipEngine account.

**Details**: Use this extension to retrieve up-to-date tracking data for any shipment from any carrier using a valid tracking number and a [supported carrier code](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/#supported-carriers) or a ShipEngine label ID.

Here's an example function call that would trigger this extension:

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFunctions, httpsCallable } from 'firebase/functions';

const app = initializeApp({
  projectId: '### CLOUD FUNCTIONS PROJECT ID ###',
  apiKey: '### FIREBASE API KEY ###',
  authDomain: '### FIREBASE AUTH DOMAIN ###',
});

const functions = getFunctions(app);

const trackLabel = httpsCallable(functions, 'trackLabel');

trackLabel({
  trackingNumber: '9405511899223197428490',
  carrierCode: 'stamps_com',
}).then((result) => {
  // Read result of the Cloud Function.
  /** @type {any} */
  const data = result.data;
});
```
