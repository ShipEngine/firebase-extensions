Use this extension to validate addresses using the ShipEngine API.

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('addresses')
  .add({
    address: {
      name: 'John Smith',
      addressLine1: '200 Sunrise Mall',
      cityLocality: 'Massapequa',
      stateProvince: 'NY',
      postalCode: '11758',
      countryCode: 'US',
    },
  });
```

When you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **ShipEngine API Key** from the [ShipEngine API Management page](https://app.shipengine.com/#/portal/apimanagement).
