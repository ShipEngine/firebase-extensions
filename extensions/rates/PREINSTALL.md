  .add({
    shipment: {
      validateAddress: 'no_validation',
      shipTo: {
        name: 'Amanda Miller',
        phone: '555-555-5555',
        addressLine1: '525 S Winchester Blvd',
        cityLocality: 'San Jose',
        stateProvince: 'CA',
        postalCode: '95128',
        countryCode: 'US',
        addressResidentialIndicator: 'yes',
      },
      shipFrom: {
        companyName: 'Example Corp.',
        name: 'John Doe',
        phone: '111-111-1111',
        addressLine1: '4009 Marathon Blvd',

        addressResidentialIndicator: 'no',
      },
      packages: [
        {
          weight: {
            value: 1.0,
            unit: 'ounce',
          },
        },
