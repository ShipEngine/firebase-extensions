Use this extension to calculate real-time shipping rates across 50+ global carriers from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection. [ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/) retrieves all possible rates to help brands, ecommerce platforms, and 3PLs to make the best choice for every shipment, whether shipping cost, time to delivery, carrier capabilities or other factors are most important.

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('shipments')
  .add({
    shipment: {
      shipTo: {
        name: 'Amanda Miller',
        addressLine1: '525 S Winchester Blvd',
        cityLocality: 'San Jose',
        stateProvince: 'CA',
        postalCode: '95128',
        countryCode: 'US',
      },
      shipFrom: {
        companyName: 'Example Corp.',
        name: 'John Doe',
        phone: '111-111-1111',
        addressLine1: '4009 Marathon Blvd',
        addressLine2: 'Suite 300',
        cityLocality: 'Austin',
        stateProvince: 'TX',
        postalCode: '78756',
        countryCode: 'US',
      },
      packages: [
        {
          weight: {
            value: 1.0,
            unit: 'ounce',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  });
```
