Use this extension to validate addresses.

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('shipments')
  .add({
    shipment: {
      carrierId: 'se-423887',
      serviceCode: 'usps_media_mail',
      shipDate: '2021-09-21',
      validateAddress: 'no_validation',
      shipTo: {
        name: 'Amanda Miller',
        addressLine1: '525 S Winchester Blvd',
        cityLocality: 'San Jose',
        stateProvince: 'CA',
        postalCode: '95128',
        countryCode: 'US',
      },
      shipFrom: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        phone: '111-111-1111',
        addressLine1: '4009 Marathon Blvd',
        addressLine2: 'Suite 300',
        cityLocality: 'Austin',
        stateProvince: 'TX',
        postalCode: '78756',
        countryCode: 'US',
      },
      packages: [
        {
          weight: {
            value: 1.0,
            unit: 'ounce',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  });
```
