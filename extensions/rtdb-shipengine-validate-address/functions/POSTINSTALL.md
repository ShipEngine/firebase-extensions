### See it in action

You can test out this extension right away!

1.  Go to your [Realtime Database dashboard][rtdb-console] in the Firebase
    console.
2.  In the path `/addresses`, add a child node with any name and the value
    `{"content":"Hello World"}`.
3.  In a few seconds, you'll see multiple sibling nodes to `address` with the validated address.
